 Count nodes of linked list

Sample Input 1 :
3 4 5 2 6 1 9 -1
Sample Output 1 :
7

int length(Node *head)
{
	Node* temp = head;
    int cnt=0;
    while(temp)
    {
        temp =temp->next;
        cnt++;
    }
    return cnt;
}


The provided code is a C++ function named length that calculates the length of a linked list. 
It takes a pointer to the head of the linked list (Node *head) as its parameter. 
The function uses a while loop to traverse the linked list, counting the number of nodes until the end is reached. 
The variable cnt is incremented for each node encountered, and the final count is returned.
